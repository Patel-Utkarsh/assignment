      question: "What happens if I don't clear the Charter? Can I still show Stoa on my profile?",
      answer: "Upon completing the Stoa program with a 60% aggregate, individuals are granted access to placements and the optional charter exam. However, if an individual does not pass the charter exam, they will not be awarded the charter holder certificate. Nevertheless, they will still receive the Stoa Program completion certificate and be granted access to valuable career assistance resources. Although individuals will not have the ability to showcase the Stoa Charter on their profile, they can still reference their completion of the Stoa program and the valuable knowledge and skills they have acquired."

      question: "Is there an income share agreement or a no-cost EMI?",

The Stoa community helps individuals in their growth by providing access to a vast network of professionals, which can lead to job opportunities and career growth.
